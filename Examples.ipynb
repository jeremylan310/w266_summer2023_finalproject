Delicious? Amazing service?!? What else can I say! The coffee is balanced AND they make their syrups in-house. I got the caramel macchiato, not too sweet, not too milky, just how I love my lattes! My goal is to try their whole menu cause I\\'m sure it\\'ll all be delicious. Customer service was also on point, friendly and helpful. He even gave us some extra stamps! Don\\'t forget to bring your stamp cards! They are also pup friendly, gotta wear your masks and make sure to social distance. Tables are spread out 6ft apart which is a plus and they also have outdoor tables as well. Delicious cold brew! I love checking out local coffee shops, especially during these hard times. The cold brew is delicious! I will definitely be returning! This place is great! The staff was so friendly, it caught my eye when they first opened and I saw the store owner standing outside with a \"Free Coffee\" sign. I decided I would stop to try it on my way to school. It was great! The atmosphere was very comfortable as well. They do the coffee with a cop. They had their coffee for sale in cute little bags for the holidays. I found the coffee smooth and not to bitter. I drink cold coffee all year young so iced is always for me.\\nThe girl that was working and I had a good laugh together about how we always drink iced coffee. They have punch cards which is a nice touch.\\nI could definitely see myself coming in here to hang out and drink coffee. I wish they had a few more tables and maybe some more food like pastries etc. They will do great with that location. I have lived in Tucson all my life. Almost 43-gritting through my teeth and summer-years. I hadn\\'t heard of this place!! \\u200d\\n\\nTwo of our closest local coffee shops recently closed. I wanted a local place that roasted beans to have at home. I searched on IG and came across this gem! \\n\\nAwesome coffee! Great breakfast tacos!! Excellent spot to chat and read. Amazing date spot. My husband and I are hooked! So glad I found This was a really cool location to visit for my first stop this morning for a cup of coffee. I was able to walk to this location from my hotel stay, was greeted when I walked in the door as well as had a chance to view a little bit of the menu and the surroundings on the inside. The associate working the counter she was helpful she asked me if it was my first time and I informed to her yes. So she proceeded to inform me of what they offer and also a few suggestions on what I possibly might like. So I ordered a small cinnamon crunch coffee. Was very delicious and I was able to enjoy my coffee while sitting outside on their seating patio. We just moved to an apartment close by and heard that this locations was pretty good so we wanted to give it a shot. Living within walking distance we decided to take a walk to the Tucson Coffee Roasters this morning. Upon entering we were greeted by a polite barista who made us feel welcomed. The atmosphere was great, it would be a place for anyone who wants to come to study or even sit and to relax. I didn\\'t know what to try out but was recommended by the barista to try it out. So I decided to try the whisky aged coffee in a size medium. The portion size was not bad and for the price it was reasonable. I suggest getting it with sugar since it would be bland. The aroma on the other hand is splendid, it remind me of when I was in Chicago trying it out for the first time. I recommend giving this place a try if you\\'re on this side of town! I got a prickly pear iced tea here with zero prickly pear in it. I asked if it would be sweet and they said no, but there was cane sugar at the cream and sugar station. I just wish they would have also told me it was going to be plain tea. \\n\\nThat said, the inside is pretty nice. They have high ceilings, a couch, interesting art work, and a take-a-book-leave-a-book policy. \\n\\nIf my wife had liked what she ordered, I might have raised the rating. Maybe the straight up coffee is good, but they probably need to take the decaf and tea options off the menu. I hate to give places such a low rating, but unfortunately Tucson Coffee Roasters did not deliver on my particular order. I got an iced decaf latte with oat milk. I was so excited to see they had oat milk, as I\\'m trying to reduce my dairy intake. I love oat milk since it\\'s usually super smooth and creamy. My drink was anything but, and had a watered down kind of grainy taste. I\\'m wondering if that\\'s because it was decaf? Not sure but many other coffee shops have made delicious decaf lattes. I couldn\\'t finish my drink and that\\'s a pretty bad sign. That being said, the interior is super cute and modern and would be a great place to study or get some work done. I\\'m a frequent visitor to this pleasant and high quality coffee House. They\\'re roast coffees are very very fine and the coffee house itself has much indoor seating and a small amount of outdoor seating. Covid regulations seem to be pretty well observed. My mom and I have been going around tucson trying a bunch of different coffee places during this quarantine and this place is SOOOOO good!! Their coffee tastes fresh, the service is fast, and it\\'s generally such a great place. If you haven\\'t tried it, I would go today!!!'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"9jEc0iVaYK3s"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
