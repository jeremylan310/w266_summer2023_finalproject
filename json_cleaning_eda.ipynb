It\\'s very easy to access with plenty of parking. \\n\\nThe staff was nice.   We stopped in for breakfast which we enjoyed.  \\n\\nThe place is clean and there is a nice shop when you enter (like all other locations)\\n\\nWe will definitely be back This is one Cracker Barrel of the now 6 locations in NJ . It used to be only 2 at one time . This one is located right off the NJ Turnpike at exit 5. \\n\\nCracker Barrel is an affordable dining spot better known for breakfast but also serves lunch and dinner \\n\\nIt has a country and antique flair... rocking chairs upon walking in and cute store when you walk in that is fun to take a gander. \\n\\nStaff is always nice \\n\\nFood can be hit or miss  but I had a good meal at this location. I like the country fried steak. You get to choose several sides and get a complimentary corn bread and biscuit . I like the raspberry iced tea \\n\\nThey had the fireplace going when I was there and it was a nice touch! Especially when it was chilly outside that night. How could anyone dislike Cracker Barrel? Such a staple American institution. \\n\\nFrom the cool antique/art hanging all around the restaurant to the amazing food. I always get the chicken fried chicken and it never disappoints. I brought my wife for the first time and she fell in love with the entire place from the food to the shop. \\n\\nOur server Tyler did an amazing job, quick and attentive service. \\n\\nI will be back soon and every time I\\'m in the area. What a great time at my first Cracker Barrel experience! \\n\\nOur server, Tyler, was friendly and attentive. He was kind and brought out our food super fast!\\nThe food here is delicious. I don\\'t know what the bad reviews are for- but I love Cracker Barrel! Pretty huge servings with reasonable pricing. They even had a fire place there which was really cozy to look at in the cold wintry day. I had the Sunday Homestyle Chicken which was crunchy, crispy and piping hot. I ordered Mac and cheese, and their steak fries. We also ordered their apple cobbler with ice cream and IT IS SO GOOD !!!!! Highly recommend !!!\\n\\nOnly if they have a Cracker Barrel closer to home in NY... This establishment is just your typical Cracker Barrel, nothing more, nothing less.  It\\'s located a stone\\'s throw away from exit 5 on the New Jersey Turnpike, making it a popular stop for busses and tourists passing through.  Wait times for a table are typically short, but a motorcoach or two pulling in can blow that up instantly.\\nYou\\'ll be hard pressed to find too many healthy dining options here, but the \"Southern inspired\" menu is generally pretty tasty.  Breakfast choices are pretty can\\'t miss.  Over the years the prices have gone up gradually, but serving sizes have shrunk considerably.  This is a bad trade off.  Service is wildly inconsistent here, and is often completely dependent on who your server is, and turnover seems very high.  Some servers are wonderfully talented and friendly (looking at you, April!), while others have very little business being in the service industry.  If you see a \"Rising Star\" apron, keep your order simple, don\\'t ask any questions and hope for the best!\\nCracker Barrel fans tend to, in my opinion, gravitate to it for its familiarity.  Whether you\\'re in Texas or New York, you\\'d be hard pressed to notice a difference.  In that regard, this Cracker Barrel is just fine.  If you\\'re stuck in traffic on the Turnpike and need a place to pull off and fill your gut, you could do worse. The Misses had never been to Cracker Barrel before, and, for some reason, wanted to rectify that situation. So, we loaded up the baby and headed over for a Sunday brunch meal. We probably should have just stayed at home.\\n\\nUpon arriving, it was packed. We were told the wait time was 20 minutes, but to their credit, they got us sat way faster than that. That was the last time anything moved quickly. As I said, it was VERY busy, and Cracker Barrel was apparently not staffed for it. Literally 15 minutes passed before our SUBSTITUTE waiter arrived; he wasn\\'t our server, Kara was, but he was there to get our drink orders while we waited for Kara to show up. By this point, and without any food or anything to distract her, the baby had started her countdown to meltdown. We place our drink orders with our backup server, (a regular coffee for me, and a raspberry tea for her), and an order of toast for the babe. Side note, the flavored tea is ASTONISHINGLY sweet.\\n\\nDrinks and toast come out fine, but we still haven\\'t seen any of this elusive Kara we had heard so much about. (Also, we had to ask server #2 for the breakfast menu, as they had given us just the lunch menus). We quickly look over the menus, and after a few minutes, Kara finally makes her arrival. She was very nice, but the wait was a bit ridiculous. Also annoying, Kara is the soft spoken type. Like I said, the place was packed, so there was lots of ambient noise. Cracker Barrel also had the background Muzak going, so the Misses couldn\\'t hear anything Kara was saying. The Misses told her FOUR TIMES, \"I can\\'t hear you....\" but Kara didn\\'t raise the decibel level ONCE. Finally, I just relayed what was being said between the too. \\n\\nCommunication volume issues conquered, we got the orders in and waited for our food. By this point, I was halfway through my cup of coffee. A server walked by with a carafe, and said \"sir, did you have regular or decaf?\" I said \"regular\" and that was the end of that.....he just strolled off, with his carafe of decaf, never to return with regular coffee. Oh well. \\n\\nThe food finally makes it to the table, and by now, we are in Toddler Meltdown level 2; shes out of the high chair, and tossing food off the side of the table, so we ask for to-go boxes immediately. Kara whispers if we need anything else, and I ask for more coffee, plus my biscuits that didn\\'t come out with the rest of the food. \\n\\nWe spend the next 2 minutes WOLFING down rubbery eggs, flavorless grits and gravy, and old looking sausage and bacon. The pancakes were ok at least. We ask for the check and get out of dodge; the Misses completely underwhelmed with her inaugural Cracker Barrel experience.\\n\\nCracker Barrel avoids one star because the people were nice, the food isn\\'t expensive, and they have good choices, but you will be utterly nonplussed. It\\'s a kitschy, main street Americana themed diner. But, you probably already knew that. This location is probably a little busier than others because it\\'s RIGHT off of the NJ Turnpike. Eh, we won\\'t be back for a very long time, if ever. Decided to treat the family to brunch and this was a great place to go on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch. \\nThey have no problem seating 7 people and did not have a ling wait either.  The waitress was really attentive and fun.  Really know how to entertain her customers. \\nThe menu has plenty to choose from and breakfast is all day.  The food is good but of average tasty.  But always worth going back to try My first time at a Cracker Barrel and I have to admit, I low key loved the place. The store portion is as experience within itself and actually since we had to wait a while to sit down, worked out in our favor. There was a lot of browse. They put out holiday stuff quite early and I wasn\\'t ready for it in August. There is a lot of other things to explore though. \\n\\nOnce we sat down, I was surprised to see that there were many empty tables and we still had about an hour\\'s wait. I was there in August of 2021, for context. Anyway, what I like it that there are a lot of options for you. I wasn\\'t expecting to find any healthy options at all but I was pleasantly surprised. I didn\\'t like that you can\\'t customize the sampler. It was a shame because I don\\'t eat pork but I wanted to try more of the menu. Anyway, huge fan of the cornbread and the bread rolls. I ended up getting grilled fish which was pretty standard. My husband got the meatloaf which was really good. Would get that for the next time I go. Also definitely get their Mac and cheese, it\\'s amazing. \\n\\nIt\\'s priced appropriately, you definitely have to visit one at least once! I haven\\'t visited this Cracker Barrel in a year. They are warm and friendly when you enter the store, greeting you as if you had just arrived at Grandma\\'s House. The wait was less than 5 mins. Our waitress was friendly, fast and attentive. I had the fried catfish, kale and Brussels sprout slaw, French fries and broccoli. It was all so good and freshly cooked. This is the best experience I have had at this location years. I would have given them a 5 but my silver ware was cloudy and dirty looking and my glass of water had stuff on the glass. They need more hot water and soap. I asked for plastic ware and that solved my dilemma. I would go back but I\\'m not rushing back. Only 6 tables of 4. Waited about 10 minutes at 2:30 in the afternoon. Was a delightful late lunch. Thursday special Turkey dinner was delicious.  Always a quality meal for the price.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Average length of each restaurant's top-rated review: \" + str(round(df_top1['text'].str.split().str.len().mean(),1)))\n","\n","print(\"Average length of each restaurant's top 10 reviews (concatenated): \" + str(round(df_concatenated['review_words'].mean(),1)))\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"o8DvChae4hFm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1689632041080,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":379,"user":{"displayName":"Jeremy Lan","userId":"17649289417541310223"}},"outputId":"5e2b5d74-74f8-4e9a-fae7-3c2a24987771"},"id":"o8DvChae4hFm","execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Average length of each restaurant's top-rated review: 203.2\n","Average length of each restaurant's top 10 reviews (concatenated): 1602.3\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_top10.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/W266 Notes/W266 Final Project/df_top10reviews.csv', index = False)\n","\n","df_concatenated.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/W266 Notes/W266 Final Project/df_concatenated.csv', index = False)\n","\n","df_top1.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/W266 Notes/W266 Final Project/df_top_review.csv', index = False)"],"metadata":{"id":"rNzCwyrFWoR7"},"id":"rNzCwyrFWoR7","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.13"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
